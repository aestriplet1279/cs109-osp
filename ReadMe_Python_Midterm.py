My "Kelvin Calcutor" coding process consisted of creating an multiple
if else statements using user input.To decide whether or not to convert from
Celsius or Farenheit to Kelvin. Next, I use a while loop to have to the user decide
whether they want to continue convertign or not. If yes is chosen the user is able to
convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius and if no is chosen the code breaks.
